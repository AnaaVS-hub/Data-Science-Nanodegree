## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project called **"Write a Data Science Blog"** is the 1st project assigned as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree program.

For the Boston Airbnb dataset, I was majorly interested in finding out:

1. What factors can a User keep in mind while selecting a stay with Airbnb in order to find cheaper as well as safer options?
2. What factors can a Host keep in mind while putting their place up for rent with Airbnb in order to gain the maximum benefit from it?
3. What factors show the highest variation in relation to prices of the stays in Boston?
4. What other analysis can be part of this - in order to extend the results to actionable recommendations for both Users and Hosts?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook available here that captures the cleaned exploratory analysis done on the dataset, the selected final variables for the price model and its implementation too. Comments and conclusions have been provided in the notebook to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://anaa-vs.medium.com/this-is-how-you-should-rent-or-lend-a-stay-via-airbnb-a8bf70a3459c).

Thanks to Kaggle - I had the required [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston?select=listings.csv) for my analysis! 

In case, you'd like to have a look at complete datasets and get your hands dirty with the entire repository that Airbnb provides, check [this](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) out!

As for this code, feel free to use it, fork it, comment on it :)
